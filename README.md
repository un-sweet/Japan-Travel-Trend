## Project Overview

This project investigates travel trends of Taiwanese tourists in Japan. Given Japan's popularity among Taiwanese travelers, we aim to see if there's a shift from major tourist spots like Tokyo and Kyoto to less popular destinations.

The analysis will use the Japan travel discussion board on Taiwan's PTT, similar to Reddit. The project will:

- **Examine Trends:** Check if there is an increasing interest in less popular tourist spots.
- **Classify Content:** Use supervised classification methods like Random Forest and Naive Bayes to categorize text about tourist attractions and evaluate the models' performance.
- **Apply STM:** Implement the Structural Topic Model (STM) to categorize travel experiences based on geographical regions or other criteria.
